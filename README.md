### Our Design
First, we generically typed our ArrayPriorityQueue class and implemented the Comparable interface so that it would work with any object that is Comparable.
We then created the Ticket class which includes instance variables for the following:

1. VIP level
..* This is how we will keep our Array Priority queue organized. It is a random number from 0 to 10. 0 being the highest priority.  

2. ID number
..* This ID number is a number that shows the chronological order in which each of the tickets were added to the queue.

3. Description
..* This is a description of the problem that the user is experiencing based on reader input. 
4. Name
..* This will be the name of the person that is experiencing the problem and will be decided based on reader input.

5. Solution Description

6. Solved
..* This instance variable is a boolean and if it is true, then the problem has been solved and can be removed from the queue of tickets.
